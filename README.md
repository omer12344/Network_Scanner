During summer vacation, we developed a Network Scanner and Analyzer using Python and various networking libraries, including Scapy and socket. This project enables users to scan and analyze network devices and traffic, making it a valuable tool for network administrators and security professionals.

Key Features:

-Scans the local network to discover live hosts using ARP requests.

-Detects open ports on remote devices using TCP and UDP port scanning techniques.

-Analyzes network traffic, categorizing packets by protocol (HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DHCP, ARP, -Ethernet) and layer (Application, Transport, Network, Link Layer).

-Provides detailed statistics on packets exchanged between local and global networks, including the number of packets sent and received.

-Displays open ports and their associated services for each discovered IP address.

-Identifies and separates local and global network traffic for in-depth analysis.
