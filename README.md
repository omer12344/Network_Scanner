# Network_Scanner
During summer vacation, my friend Adam and I developed a Network Scanner and Analyzer using Python and various networking libraries, including Scapy and socket. This project enables users to scan and analyze network devices and traffic, making it a valuable tool for network administrators and security professionals.
